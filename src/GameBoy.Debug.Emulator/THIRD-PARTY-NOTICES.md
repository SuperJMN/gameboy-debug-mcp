## CoreBoy (vendored, distributed)

The `CoreBoy/` subfolder of the `GameBoy.Debug.Emulator` project contains a
trimmed, vendored copy of the **CoreBoy** Game Boy emulator core by **David Whitney**
(https://github.com/davidwhitney/CoreBoy), which is a C# port of **coffee-gb** by
**Tomasz Rękawek** (https://github.com/trekawek/coffee-gb). This code is compiled
into `GameBoy.Debug.Emulator.dll`, which ships inside the `GameBoy.Mcp` package.

Both CoreBoy and coffee-gb are licensed under the MIT License. The upstream
copyright notice is preserved verbatim at
`src/GameBoy.Debug.Emulator/CoreBoy/LICENSE` and reproduced below:

### Modifications to CoreBoy

The vendored `CoreBoy/` sources were trimmed and lightly adapted for a headless
debugging host. Emulation logic is otherwise unchanged.

- Removed UI/audio frontends and their dependencies (ImageSharp, NAudio,
  Newtonsoft.Json, CommandLineParser): `gui/BitmapDisplay`, `gui/GameboyDisplayFrame`,
  `gui/WinSound`, `gui/Emulator`, `gui/ConsoleWriteSerialEndpoint`, the `debugging/`
  command system, and `memory/cart/battery/FileBattery`.
- `GameboyOptions`: removed `CommandLine` attributes.
- `memory/cart/Cartridge`: always uses `NullBattery` (battery saves are not needed).
- `cpu/Cpu`: added a read-only `InterruptMasterEnabled` accessor (IME is not memory-mapped).
- `memory/Mmu`: added a `WriteObserver` hook to support the find_last_writer /
  trace_until_write debugging tools.

## SameBoy (optional backend, NOT distributed)

The repository contains an optional, legacy native backend (`GameBoy.Debug.SameBoy`
and `native/sameboy_mcp_bridge.c`) that links against **SameBoy** by **Lior Halphon**
(https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy). SameBoy is **not** vendored in this repository
and is **not** included in the published `GameBoy.Mcp` package; it is cloned and built
from source only when a developer explicitly opts in. The bridge file
`native/sameboy_mcp_bridge.c` is original code of this project that calls SameBoy's
public C API.
