# GameBoy.Mcp

`GameBoy.Mcp` is a cross-platform .NET MCP server for inspecting and controlling a Game Boy or Game Boy Color ROM. It is distributed as a .NET tool (command: `gameboymcp`).

The emulator core is **pure managed C#** (a trimmed, vendored copy of the MIT-licensed [CoreBoy](https://github.com/davidwhitney/CoreBoy), itself a port of [coffee-gb](https://github.com/trekawek/coffee-gb)). There are **no native dependencies**, so a single package runs anywhere .NET 10 runs — Windows, macOS and Linux, on x64 and arm64.

## Install

Run it on demand with .NET 10's `dnx` (no install required):

```bash
dnx GameBoy.Mcp
```

Or install it globally:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g GameBoy.Mcp
gameboymcp
```

## Build

Requirements:

- .NET 10 SDK

Build the solution:

```bash
dotnet build gameboy-debug-mcp.slnx
```

That's it — no native toolchain or build step is required.

## Run

From the repo root:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/GameBoy.Debug.Mcp/GameBoy.Debug.Mcp.csproj
```

Screen captures are returned inline as PNG images over MCP; no files are written.

## Connect An MCP Client

Use stdio transport. With the tool installed (or via `dnx`), the client entry is path-independent:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gameboy": {
      "command": "dnx",
      "args": ["GameBoy.Mcp", "--yes"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you installed the tool globally (`dotnet tool install -g GameBoy.Mcp`), use the command directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gameboy": {
      "command": "gameboymcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For development against a local checkout you can still run it from source:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gameboy": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "src/GameBoy.Debug.Mcp/GameBoy.Debug.Mcp.csproj"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Limitations

- The managed core skips the external boot ROM and applies a standard post-boot register state. This is deterministic and practical for debugging, but it is not a boot-ROM-accurate startup trace.
- Conditional breakpoints are evaluated by the C# session loop and support register and memory comparisons such as `A == 0x10`, `HL >= 0xC000`, and `[HL] < 4`.
- `.sym` parsing is intentionally simple: `BANK:ADDR Name` and `ADDR Name` lines with `;` or `#` comments.
- `capture_screen` returns inline PNG image content.
- Savestates capture CPU registers and all CPU-visible RAM/IO; MBC bank selection and sub-frame PPU/APU timing are not captured, so save/restore is intended at frame boundaries.

## Emulator Core

The emulator is a pure-managed C# core: a trimmed, vendored copy of [CoreBoy](https://github.com/davidwhitney/CoreBoy) by David Whitney (MIT), itself a C# port of [coffee-gb](https://github.com/trekawek/coffee-gb) by Tomasz Rękawek (MIT). Only the emulation core is kept (CPU, MMU, PPU, timers, interrupts, sound, serial, cartridge mappers); UI/audio frontends and their dependencies are removed. See [`src/GameBoy.Debug.Emulator/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](src/GameBoy.Debug.Emulator/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) for full attribution, license texts, and the list of modifications.

A legacy, optional native backend (`GameBoy.Debug.SameBoy`) links against [SameBoy](https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy) by Lior Halphon (Expat/MIT). SameBoy is not vendored and is not part of the published tool; it is cloned and built from source only if a developer opts in.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE) © José Manuel Nieto (@SuperJMN).

It includes third-party software under its own license. The vendored CoreBoy core (MIT) is distributed inside the `GameBoy.Mcp` package; its copyright notice and the notices for all third-party components are reproduced in [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](src/GameBoy.Debug.Emulator/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md), which is also bundled in the published package. All third-party authors retain full ownership of their work.

## Test

```bash
dotnet test gameboy-debug-mcp.slnx
```

The managed-core integration tests run on every platform with no native dependency. If the optional SameBoy native library (`native/out/linux-x64/libgameboy_debug_sameboy.so`) exists, the legacy SameBoy integration tests also run.

## Deployment

Distribution is handled by [DotnetDeployer](https://github.com/SuperJMN/DotnetDeployer), configured in [`deployer.yaml`](deployer.yaml). It packs the `GameBoy.Mcp` tool and pushes it to NuGet. Because the emulator core is pure managed C#, the package is a single architecture-agnostic artifact that runs on every platform — no per-RID native builds.

Publish locally (requires the `NUGET_API_KEY` environment variable):

```bash
dnx dotnetdeployer.tool            # add --dry-run to pack without publishing
```

CI/CD is provided by [DotnetDeployer.Fleet](https://github.com/SuperJMN/DotnetDeployer.Fleet): a coordinator/worker that clones the repo and runs DotnetDeployer on every commit. Any worker with the .NET 10 SDK can build and publish the package.
